         <p>Dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I have opted for Industrial Engineering as my major during undergraduate studies. 
            Industrial Engineering is like a bridge between business processes and optimization of work to achieve business goals. 
            It was during my study in engineering, I was exposed to various problem solving techniques in Production Planning,
            Information science, Supply Chain Management, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Complex Distribution plans which 
            improve profits. As an academic project, I had carried a mini research project titled “Market Optimization” at GITAM University. 
            This project was emphasized on Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMGC). The demand for FMGC products during festive season will be huge.
            In order to handle the situation I have initiated a process on Value Chain Management which enables the vendors and customers to have a hassle free shopping.
            However, my research to optimize was partially successful since this project involved a lot of data to be ascertained from different sources while I was working on it. 
            I had come to a conclusion that after this project the Data mining or Data extraction plays a vital role in every division of business. 
            This provoked me to take up an internship focusing on Data.
         </p>
         <p>Sincerely,</p>
         <p>Venkat Madhav Venigalla</p>
